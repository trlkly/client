				<h4>0.6.0 <small>March 7, 2019</small></h4>
				<div class="change-log-entry">
					<p class="developer-message">
						This release, like the previous one, has been mostly about code quality and features for editors and me,
						the developer. I'm hoping that I can now start putting in more features for the end-user as we move
						towards version 0.7. If you have ideas for new features, or you have any problems with the extension
						as it is, don't hesitate to
						<a href="https://github.com/Questionable-Content-Extensions/client/issues">tell us about them</a>!
						While I have quite a lot of ideas left to implement, I'd also love to implement ideas that aren't just
						my own.
					</p>
					<h5>New features</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>If a comic takes too long to load, show a loading indicator. What's considered "too long" is configurable in the settings dialog</li>
						<li>You can now open this change log at any time from the settings dialog, not just when a new version is out</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Changes/fixes</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Random comic navigation now respects exclusion settings</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Editor features</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Add support for the new item image system and for image uploading. This allows uploading images directly in the browser (was previously a tedious server-only job), and also allows for multiple images per item</li>
						<li>Add edit log view. The server keeps track of all changes editors make, this view lets you see that log</li>
						<li>Add flags for indicating whether a comic is lacking certain features, such as marking a comic as not having characters. Currently only used by the "comic missing X" feature so it doesn't indicate a comic having an error where missing X isn't erroneous</li>
						<li>Ensure there are updating/loading indicators when changes are made, so it's clear that something's happening and that you don't accidentally do multiple potentially conflicting things</li>
